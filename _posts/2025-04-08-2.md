Laser Lock Box Moku:Pro User Manual


The Moku:Pro Laser Lock Box enables you to stabilize a laser's frequency to a reference cavity or atomic transition using high-performance modulation locking techniques. The Laser Lock Box is designed with the concept of staged locking and a “Lock Assist”, enabling a user-defined locking process to quickly lock to any zero-crossing on the demodulated error signal. It also features an integrated four-channel Oscilloscope, allowing you to observe signals at any point in the signal processing chain at up to 1.25 GSa/s. Additionally, the built-in Data Logger enables long-term recording of signals.

# <a name="_toc_250015"></a>Introduction
Laser locking systems are widely used to control and match a laser’s frequency to an optical frequency reference, such as an optical reference cavity or atomic transition. Such systems are vital for high-resolution interferometric measurement, spectroscopy, and time and frequency standards.

Locking a laser by forcing the laser and reference frequency to be equal allows for two scenarios:

- The locking system steers the laser frequency to be equal to the reference frequency, which is referred to as frequency stabilization; and
- The locking system forces the reference frequency to follow the laser frequency, which is referred to as frequency tracking.


Whether used for frequency stabilization or frequency tracking, the Moku:Pro Laser Lock Box is designed to assist in high-performance, high-gain laser locking systems. It offers advanced setup, acquisition, and diagnostic features that makes it easier and quicker to set up and characterize laser locking systems.

# <a name="_toc_250014"></a>User Interface
The main user interface is divided into upper and lower screen sections. The upper user interface displays the processing chain and principal controls of the Laser Lock Box.

## <a name="_toc_250005"></a>Local oscillator
The demodulation signal source can be configured in the settings dialog.

![](Aspose.Words.fb1d137f-ec18-4dcb-b31e-9c68839a6377.027.jpeg)


## <a name="_toc_250004"></a>Demodulation
The demodulation mode determines which reference oscillator is used to demodulate the input signal.

Modulation

The input signal can be demodulated with the modulation signal, which is user-configured here. This local oscillator is locked to the modulation signal with a frequency range from 1 mHz to 300 MHz.

Internal

The input signal can be demodulated with an internally generated reference signal. This local oscillator is derived from the Moku:Pro internal clock and thus shares the same timebase. The frequency range of the internal reference is 1 mHz to 600 MHz.

External

The input signal can be demodulated by a direct external reference, permitting the use of non- sinusoidal demodulation using the input signal applied on input 2.

External (PLL)

External (PLL) mode enables the Laser Lock Box to lock to an externally sourced demodulation reference applied to input 2. This mode uses a digitally implemented phase-locked loop (PLL) to track the phase of the external reference with a user configurable bandwidth. To configure the bandwidth of the PLL, tap the PLL icon to select the bandwidth between 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The PLL will automatically lock to the strongest harmonic of the external reference in the range of

10 Hz to 600 MHz with a manually configurable local phase shift. The PLL can be manually set as low at 10 Hz. The PLL can be frequency multiplied up to 250x or divided down to 1/8x with the Multiplier for use as local oscillator, minimum Multiplier step size is 1/8th. The reacquire button can be used to relock to the external reference.

None

The demodulation step can be bypassed by selecting “None.” This enables modulation-free locking techniques such as DC locking, fringe-side locking, and tilt locking.

# <a name="_toc_250003"></a>Lower User Interface

Add action

Choose any of the available actions to add to each locking stage. When engaged, all of the actions associated with that stage will be enabled simultaneously.

## <a name="_toc_250001"></a>Oscilloscope
The Moku:Pro Laser Lock Box includes a built-in Oscilloscope, enabling you to observe and record data of up to four signals at a time in the Laser Lock Box’s processing chain.

The Oscilloscope will appear automatically when a probe point ![](Aspose.Words.fb1d137f-ec18-4dcb-b31e-9c68839a6377.030.png) is activated.

You can hide the Oscilloscope by pressing the ![](Aspose.Words.fb1d137f-ec18-4dcb-b31e-9c68839a6377.031.jpeg) icon and reveal it by pressing the ![](Aspose.Words.fb1d137f-ec18-4dcb-b31e-9c68839a6377.032.jpeg) icon.

Lock Assist feature

The Lock Assist can only be enabled after the locking stage is configured. When the Lock Assist is enabled, the trigger settings will be configured to synchronize the oscilloscope traces with the scan waveform. Selecting one of the error signal’s zero crossings will then adjust the output offset to the corresponding voltage and engage the first locking stage which is not already fully engaged.


Additional details about the Oscilloscope can be found in the Moku:Pro Oscilloscope manual.

## <a name="_toc_250000"></a>Data Logger
The built-in Data Logger allows you to acquire data from up to four probe points at a time at a maximum sampling rate of 2.5 MSa/s with three or four channels, 5 MSa/s with two channels and 10

MSa/s with one channel. To access the data acquisition menu, press the ![](Aspose.Words.fb1d137f-ec18-4dcb-b31e-9c68839a6377.033.png)icon. More details

about Data Logger are available in the Moku:Go Data Logger manual.
